<!-- My structure
1. index.html:
   - Collects player's name using a form.
   - Submits it to `playing.html` (currently via basic form navigation).

2. playing.html:
   - Loads the p5.js library.
   - Includes a `<script src="sketch.js"></script>` line at the bottom of the `<main>` block.
   - This script draws the Tic Tac Toe board and handles interaction.

3. sketch.js:
   - This file contains the actual drawing and interaction logic using p5.js.

4. style.css:
   - Applies consistent layout and style to both html pages.
   - `canvas` style makes the board visible and styled.
